# PewDiePie Discord Bot

Do you have any more questions about the bot? Send a DM to **Kowlin#4417 or A Trash Coder#0981** or join the [support server](https://discord.gg/we4DQ5u).

## Why did I make this bot?

I made this bot because I was very intrigued into the PewDiePie vs T-Series war. I wanted to do my part and make a bot.

## How should I run the bot?

I strongly recommend that you [invite the bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=500868806776979462&scope=bot&permissions=338717761). Nevertheless, here are the instructions.

### Instructions

1. **Install Python 3.6+**

I use Python 3.7 for production and testing purposes so results may vary.

2. **Install dependencies**

Run `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

3. **Install PostgreSQL**

The latest version of PostgreSQL is recommended.

You will need...

+ A database named `tseries`
+ Username and password

Note your username and password.

4. **Fill out credentials**

Open up `config-example.py` and follow the instructions in the docstring.

5. **Start the bot**

Run `python pewdiepie.py`
